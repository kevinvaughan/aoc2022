    "The first half of the monkeys' notes is a map of the board. It is comprised of a set of open tiles (on which you can move, drawn .) and solid walls (tiles which you cannot enter, drawn #).\n",

    "The second half is a description of the path you must follow. It consists of alternating numbers and letters:\n",
    "\n",
    "A number indicates the number of tiles to move in the direction you are facing. If you run into a wall, you stop moving forward and continue with the next instruction.\n",
    "A letter indicates whether to turn 90 degrees clockwise (R) or counterclockwise (L). Turning happens in-place; it does not change your current tile.\n",
    "So, a path like 10R5 means \"go forward 10 tiles, then turn clockwise 90 degrees, then go forward 5 tiles\".\n",

In other words, if your next tile is off of the board, you should instead look in the direction opposite of your current facing as far as you can until you find the opposite edge of the board, then reappear there.\n",

Rows start from 1 at the top and count downward; columns start from 1 at the left and count rightward. (In the above example, row 1, column 1 refers to the empty space with no tile on it in the top-left corner.) Facing is 0 for right (>), 1 for down (v), 2 for left (<), and 3 for up (^). The final password is the sum of 1000 times the row, 4 times the column, and the facing.\n",
