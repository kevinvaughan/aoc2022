    "The wind has changed direction enough to stop sending lava droplets toward you, so you and the elephants exit the cave. As you do, you notice a collection of geodes around the pond. Perhaps you could use the obsidian to create some geode-cracking robots and break them open?\n",

    "To collect the obsidian from the bottom of the pond, you'll need waterproof obsidian-collecting robots. Fortunately, there is an abundant amount of clay nearby that you can use to make them waterproof.\n",

    "\n",
    "Blueprint 1:\n",
    "  Each ore robot costs 4 ore.\n",
    "  Each clay robot costs 2 ore.\n",
    "  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 14 clay.\n",
    "  Each geode robot costs 2 ore and 7 obsidian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blueprint 2:\n",
    "  Each ore robot costs 2 ore.\n",
    "  Each clay robot costs 3 ore.\n",
    "  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 8 clay.\n",
    "  Each geode robot costs 3 ore and 12 obsidian.\n",
    "(Blueprints have been line-wrapped here for legibility. The robot factory's actual assortment of blueprints are provided one blueprint per line.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using blueprint 1 in the example above, the largest number of geodes you could open in 24 minutes is 9. One way to achieve that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "== Minute 1 ==\n",
    "1 ore-collecting robot collects 1 ore; you now have 1 ore.\n",
    "\n",
    "== Minute 2 ==\n",
    "1 ore-collecting robot collects 1 ore; you now have 2 ore.\n",
    "\n",
    "== Minute 3 ==\n",
    "Spend 2 ore to start building a clay-collecting robot.\n",
    "1 ore-collecting robot collects 1 ore; you now have 1 ore.\n",
    "The new clay-collecting robot is ready; you now have 1 of them.\n",
